# SAR Pattern Validation — Specification

## §I Interface

I1: `complete_workflow(measured_file_path, reference_file_path, ...)` — runs full registration + gamma pipeline; returns `WorkflowResult` on success, raises `WorkflowExecutionError` with `.issue: ValidationIssue | None` on structured failures.

I2: `ValidationIssue.code` is a machine-readable string (e.g. `MASK_TOO_SMALL`, `EMPTY_MEASURED_MASK`, `CSV_FORMAT_ERROR`). The Voila UI surfaces `issue.message` in the error/warning banner.

I3: `noise_floor` (W/kg) is the SAR floor below which pixels are excluded from the metric mask. Range [0, 0.1]. Must satisfy `noise_floor < measured_peak` for registration to proceed.

## §V Invariants

V1: ∀ registration call → `fixed_mask` active pixel count ≥ 1, else raise `ValidationIssue(code="EMPTY_MEASURED_MASK")` before `Execute()`. Applies at `workflows.py` after `make_metric_masks()`.

V2: ∀ `WorkflowExecutionError` raised inside `_complete_workflow` → `.issue` is preserved through exception handlers (no re-wrapping by generic `except Exception` clause). Applied via `except WorkflowExecutionError: raise` as first handler.

V3: `_apply_roi_policy` in `workflows.py` must receive `measured_mask_u8` (SAR ≥ noise cutoff, built by `loader.make_metric_masks()`) as its `measured_mask_u8` arg — never `measured_support_u8` (boundary-only). Gamma eval mask must exclude sub-cutoff (noise-filtered) pixels. Fix: `workflows.py:311`.

V4: ∀ MASK_TOO_SMALL condition (pre-registration on `measured_mask_u8` or post-registration on `evaluator.evaluation_mask`) → raises `WorkflowExecutionError` with `severity="error"` and `code="MASK_TOO_SMALL"`; workflow stops at the first failing check. Pre-registration check fires before `Rigid2DRegistration.run()`.

## §M Merge Log

Records every branch merged into `main-melanie`. Critical for squash-merge workflows: a squash-merge rewrites the tip hash, so once a PR is squash-merged the original branch tip listed here is the only reliable way to know what content was included.

| Date | Branch | Tip at merge | What it brought |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|

## §B Bug Log

| ID | Date | Root cause | Invariant |
|----|------|-----------|-----------|
| B1 | 2026-05-15 | `noise_floor ≥ measured peak` → empty fixed mask → `VirtualSampledPointSet must have 1 or more points` crash in SimpleITK, surfaced as raw ITK traceback in Voila banner | V1 |
| B2 | 2026-05-15 | `_complete_workflow` generic `except Exception` handler re-wrapped `WorkflowExecutionError` raised from inside the `try` block, discarding `.issue` | V2 |
| B3 | 2026-05-15 | `workflows.py:311` passes `measured_support_u8` (boundary-only) to `_apply_roi_policy` instead of `measured_mask_u8`; noise-filtered (SAR < cutoff) pixels included in gamma eval mask → inflated pass rate (Task 6.4) | V3 |
| B4 | 2026-05-15 | MASK_TOO_SMALL checked only post-registration; pre-registration noise-filtered `measured_mask_u8` never verified against `min_inscribed_square_mm` | V4 |
| B5 | 2026-05-15 | MASK_TOO_SMALL emitted as `severity="warning"` appended to `issues`, allowing workflow to complete; physically it is a hard validity gate — comparison on a sub-22mm mask is invalid | V4 |
